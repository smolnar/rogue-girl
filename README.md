# RogueGirl &ndash; Javascript Factory

RogueGirl is factory for you models, objects or anything in JavaScript. 

*Note: Library is currently in development state. API might change as we add new drivers or propose architecture changes.*

## Features

Let's define a model &ndash; *User*.

```coffeescript
RougeGirl.define 'user', (f) ->
 f.name = 'Peter'
 
# ...

# Let's create records
user = RogueGirl.create 'user'
user = RogueGirl.create 'user', name: 'Josh'
````

We want some fields to be unique and change with every instance. Make use of sequences.


```coffeescript
RougeGirl.define 'user', (f) ->
 f.name = 'Peter'
 
 @sequence 'number', (n) -> "Number ##{n}"
````

Do you want to have customized states of the records? Let's be dry and use traits.

```coffeescript
RougeGirl.define 'user', (f) ->
 f.name = 'Peter'
 
 @sequence 'number', (n) -> "Number ##{n}"
 
 @trait 'as admin', (f) ->
   f.name = 'Admin'
   
# ...

# Create a record with trait

user = RogueGirl.create 'user', 'as admin'
````

Do you have a relation model? Don't worry, we use associations.

```coffeescript
RogueGirl.define 'role', (f) ->
  f.name = 'Basic'
  
  @trait 'as admin', ->
    f.name = 'Admin'

# ....
    
RougeGirl.define 'user', (f) ->
 f.name = 'Peter'
 
 @association 'role'
 
 @trait 'as admin', (f) ->
   @association 'role', 'as admin'

# ....

# Build a record with association
user = RogueGirl.create 'user'

# Note: If you use Ember, you can do something like this
user.get('role.name') # => 'Basic'
user.get('role.users') # => [user]


# Build a record with a custom association, without creating a new one
role = RogueGirl.create 'role', name: 'Custom'
user = RogueGirl.create 'user', role: role

role.get('users') # => [user]
````
